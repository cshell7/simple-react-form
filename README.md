# Sign Up Form - TST Code Challenge

## Requirements

1. create a form with 3 input fields, for the username, password and confirm password respectively

- Done

2. persist the state of the input fields entries

- Not sure what you meant here. I assumed just that I was using useState for the field values.

3. the password and confirm password input field should valid there entries by comparing both values

- Done with some fun.

4. output to the user when both field match or dont match

- Done

5. bonus would be to style the form

- Done, but it has been a while since I used plain css. Typically would use styled-components or some other design/style system.

## To Review

See: `App.tsx`. I kept this flat for ease of prototyping. My next step would be to abstract some of the reusable bits into their own files, but that felt like a bit much for this code challenge.
